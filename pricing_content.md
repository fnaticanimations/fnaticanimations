## Animation Videos Content

There's no better way to quickly and effectively introduce consumers to a product than with video, especially if it's unlike anything they've seen before. Using a short two minutes animated video, start-ups can demonstrate how a product works in a way that viewers really understand. The fact is you have very little time to make an impression on consumers. With a video, you are more likely to get their attention and keep it.

When your business is new, people may want to know more about your company itself, not just the products. An explainer video provides a way to effectively demonstrate personality while you're talking about your products and services. Using creative animation, fun music, or interesting characterizations, you can say a lot about what makes your company unique. You'll be able to explain your mission and values, and why what you do is important to you and society.

Video increases the confidence of buyers. About 96% of consumers find video helpful when making a decision online, according to data from Digital Third Coast. In addition, consumers are 75% more likely to purchase a product after watching a video about it. Once a consumer has watched a video, they are more likely to understand how your product actually benefits them. This is a difficult accomplishment using just text or traditional marketing materials.

By providing valuable information to your viewers, customers develop a better understanding of the product. They are more likely to be engaged with your company and are more likely to sign up for materials to learn more. A video can incorporate all these reasons (you'll be surprised by have much information a 60 second video can hold). When you're just starting out and you're trying to get your products and services out there, a video is an efficient, convenient, and fun way to deliver information to everyone. Dropbox, Jellyfish, Dollar Shave Club, and Spotify are a few start-ups that used video to launch their start-up into high gear.

## Low budget alternative to real life commercial

Let's face it, a commercial video costs more than $50,000 and has a lead time of 12- 15 weeks.

Especially for start-ups, that is a huge investment. This is where an explainer video comes to help.

It costs 10x less and in 3 weeks, your idea is ready for the world. Simple and strategic marketing solution! Even big corporations like Google, Honeywell, Tesla, Yamaha, etc frequently use animated videos to increase brand awareness and boost sales.
