# Fnaticanimations Website Update Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the updates made to the Fnaticanimations website based on the user's requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Owner Picture Display Fix
- **Issue**: The owner's photo was being cropped (head cut off) due to CSS `object-fit: cover` property
- **Solution**: Changed CSS property to `object-fit: contain` and `object-position: center top` to ensure the full image is visible without cropping
- **File Modified**: `styles.css` (line 624-625)

### 2. Statistics Updates
The following statistics were updated throughout the website:

#### Hero Section Statistics:
- **Changed**: "1,200+ Satisfied customers worldwide"

- **Happy Clients**: Updated from "1,200+" to "3000+"

### 3. Contact Form WhatsApp Integration
- **Functionality**: The contact form now sends client details directly to WhatsApp instead of email
- **WhatsApp Number**: +923142136816
